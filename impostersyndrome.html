            What the h-e-double hockey sticks am I doing here? I can't code. It's too hard. Why am I trying?
            I didn't get my degree in anything remotely near this. Can I really do this? Who knows?
             I am here aren't I? I have been on and off with coding since January of this year. I was really good about it
             then I got really sick with a sinus infection. Then a major surgery. Then existential dread about my future. 
             Then back to making this website. I have zero idea what I want to do. As I write this, I am unsure if I really want to
             continue to code. It is not as hard as I thought it would be but it's definitely not easy.   
     </p>

        Yeah sure I know how to link things to this text. Here's an image of <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/0jLXdnXKKqI">Unsplash.com</a>.
        I can also link the color palete from <a href="https://coolors.co/palette/ffd6ff-e7c6ff-c8b6ff-b8c0ff-bbd0ff">Coolors.co</a> that I used to make this website pretty.

        I have a notebook FULL of notes from my Web Development Bootcamp course, but as I flip through it, I
        feel like I forgot everything. It's like I didn't learn a thing the past few months. Who was going to tell me it's
        okay to look things up? To utilize the free resources like YouTube or Reddit? To ask for help? I wouldn't know until I asked
        for help myself.

    <button>
        Click me!
    </button>
    <p>
        I know how to make this button but don't fully know how to make it work. Like I said I can make certain words
        magically take you to some cool pages but I am still learning the ins and outs of Javascript.

        <input type="radio" name="choice" id="hey">
        <label for="hey">hey</label>
        <input type="radio" name="choice" id="watch this">
        <label for="watch this">watch this</label>
        <input type="radio" name="choice" id="cool">
        <label for="cool">cool</label>
    </p>
    <p>
        This one will probably be a shorter blog post. I am going through my notes and can't figure out what other
        cool stuff I can show you. I'll just have to wait until I start doing more of my own projects and code alongs.
        Stay tuned!
    </p>

        Thanks for listening
